# AI-Based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS)

## 📌 Project Overview

The AI-Based Network Intrusion Detection System (NIDS) is developed to enhance network security by automatically detecting malicious activities in network traffic. The system uses machine learning techniques to classify network traffic as **normal** or **malicious**, helping in early detection of cyber attacks.

---

## 🎯 Problem Statement

Traditional rule-based network security systems are inefficient in detecting modern and unknown cyber attacks. There is a need for an intelligent, automated intrusion detection system that can analyze network traffic and identify malicious activities using machine learning.

---

## 🧠 Solution

This project uses a **Random Forest machine learning algorithm** to learn patterns from network traffic data and detect intrusions. A real-time dashboard built with **Streamlit** displays detection results and performance metrics.

## 🛠 Technologies Used

* Python
* Random Forest Algorithm (scikit-learn)
* Streamlit
* pandas, numpy
* seaborn, matplotlib
* Visual Studio Code

## ⚙️ How to Run the Project

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/AI-Based-Network-Intrusion-Detection-System.git
   ```

2. Open the project folder in **VS Code**

3. Install required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn streamlit seaborn matplotlib
   ```

4. Run the application:

   ```bash
   streamlit run nids_main.py
   ```

5. Open the browser and go to:

   ```
   http://localhost:8501
   ```
